# Wildfire Detection and Prediction Using Satelite Images

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive tool for the efficient detection and prediction of wildfires using satellite images provided by NASA, which are stored as TIFF files. The primary objective is to create a robust system capable of implementing and evaluating a wildfire detection web application.

The dataset for this project consists of high-resolution satellite images obtained from NASA, offering a diverse range of data for real-world wildfire scenarios. The project employs advanced image processing techniques and leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to achieve accurate and timely wildfire detection.

The original code is the Final Project delivery for the [UPC Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning Postgraduate Course](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/310401/postgraduate-course-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/) 2023-2023 edition, authored by:

# Wildfire Detection Overview:
The final product looks like this, you can see an image of a territory on the left and the same one the right but with the mask applied on it:

You will later select which part of the globe you wanna choose to create the mask.
